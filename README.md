Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

Overview:

This project implements a spam mail detection system using Machine Learning in Python. The model is trained on a dataset containing email text data labeled as spam or ham (not spam) to classify incoming emails effectively.

Features:

📄 Data preprocessing (text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming)

🔍 Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

🤖 Model training using various classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, etc.)

📊 Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

📩 Predicting whether an email is spam or not

Technologies Used:

🐍 Python

🗂️ Pandas (for data manipulation)

🔢 NumPy (for numerical operations)

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

🏗️ Scikit-learn (for machine learning model implementation)

📝 NLTK (for natural language processing)

Usage:

🏗️ Load the dataset and preprocess the email text.

📊 Train the spam detection model using the provided training script.

📏 Evaluate the model on test data.

📨 Use the model to classify new emails as spam or not.
